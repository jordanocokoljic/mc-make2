# Changelog

## v0.5.1 - "I don't like games with those graphics"
It's 2025, the time of the pixel aesthetic is over! The time of the pixel
aesthetic with god rays is in! This version adds mods to make the visuals of
the pack "better" (something something eye of the beholder).

* [+] [Iris Shaders](https://modrinth.com/mod/iris)

It also includes the following shaderpacks by default, as confusingly enough
the people complaining that the graphics are bad, also are unwilling to search
for a shader themselves.

* [Complementary Shaders - Reimagined](https://modrinth.com/shader/complementary-reimagined)
* [Complementary Shaders - Unbound](https://modrinth.com/shader/complementary-unbound)
* [BSL Shaders](https://modrinth.com/shader/bsl-shaders)
* [BSL Shaders - Classic](https://modrinth.com/shader/bsl-shaders-classic)

Also, the LICENSE will no longer be included in every install.


## v0.5.0 - Off to Le Cordon Bleu
Finally expanding more on the presence of Farmers Delight, this update adds a
few mods that hopefully play into the food-growing-farming fantasy that many
players find themselves attached to when playing Minecraft. In addition, a bit
of focus on fishing (not normally expanded on).

Seeking some kind of complexity, the addition of a seasons mod was considered.
The impact may not be large but should add, if nothing else, a little light
roleplay element.

A small touch up of world generate is also done, focusing on the trees (mostly
because it does add to the feeling that the world grows regardless of your
direct interaction - even if this isn't really the case).

The mods added were:

* [+] [Dynamic Trees](https://modrinth.com/mod/dynamictrees)
* [+] [Quality Food](https://modrinth.com/mod/quality-food)
* [+] [Tide](https://modrinth.com/mod/tide)
* [+] [Spice of Life Onion](https://modrinth.com/mod/spice-of-life-onion)

And dependencies:

* [+] [Cloth Config API](https://modrinth.com/mod/cloth-config)
* [+] [CreativeCore](https://modrinth.com/mod/creativecore)


## v0.4.0 - Versioning is hard
Many great mods only support the slightly newer Minecraft 1.21.1 - when first
working on this pack, the assumption was made that holding back would broaden
the options avaliable, but this assumption was wrong. To reflect this update
in opinion, the target version of the game has been bumped to 1.21.1.

* [-] [Canary](https://modrinth.com/mod/canary)
* [+] [Lithium](https://modrinth.com/mod/lithium)
* [-] [Embeddium](https://modrinth.com/mod/embeddium)
* [+] [Sodium](https://modrinth.com/mod/sodium)
* [-] [Memory Leak Fix](https://modrinth.com/mod/memoryleakfix)

The mods removed were culled because they either:
1. Didn't support 1.21.1
2. Were superseded by a more common option

Anecdotally, there doesn't seem to be much of a performance change, which is
good for both the players, and the sanity of the modpack assembly team.


## v0.3.0 - An age of exploration
This update focuses on the world players inhabit, trying to spice it up (while
still remaining true to the essence of Make²). The mods selected were picked
specifically because they make use of vanilla blocks, and don't add too much
beyond what is already expected in Minecraft. For now, this is a good balance.

In addition, they both play well with Create and it's reliance on normally
ignored stone variants, such as Andesite and Diorite and the use of Kelp as a
key ingredient in the production of belts.

The kinds of world generation considered fitting in with the "essence" of the
pack are likely to evolve over time, but for now this is a good start.

* [+] [Lithosphere](https://modrinth.com/datapack/lithosphere)
* [+] [Noisium](https://modrinth.com/mod/noisium)


## v0.2.1 - I'm still on a GTX 1080
This patch includes a new collection of mods in here all to improve performance.
Which works out well because Minecraft (particularly modded) is in desperate
need all the performance it can get.

* [+] [Alternate Current](https://modrinth.com/mod/alternate-current)
* [+] [Canary](https://modrinth.com/mod/canary)
* [+] [Embeddium](https://modrinth.com/mod/embeddium)
* [+] [Entity Culling](https://modrinth.com/mod/entityculling)
* [+] [Ferrite Core](https://modrinth.com/mod/ferrite-core)
* [+] [Get It Together, Drops](https://modrinth.com/mod/get-it-together-drops)
* [+] [Memory Leak Fix](https://modrinth.com/mod/memoryleakfix)

As an aside, from here on out links to each of the mods added or removed from
the modlist will be included within the changelog.


## v0.2.0 - What is this?
This update adds Jade (and a small compatibility addon to make it play well
with other mods, such as Create), so that players don't need to pull up the
debug menu to figure out what block is in front of them.

* [+] [Jade](https://modrinth.com/mod/jade)
* [+] [Jade Addons](https://modrinth.com/mod/jade-addons-forge)

As an aside, from here on out, new mods will be prefixed with a [+], and any
removals (hopefully not a large number), will be prefixed with [-].


## v0.1.0 - "Initial Commit"
This is Make² - a retooling of an in-dev modpack named "Make" that was running
on a later version of Minecraft. The goal of the modpack is to retain a very
vanilla feel, while still giving players the options of specializing down
specific ways-of-play.

This version adds the mods that inspired the pack the most, and one addition to
ensure players don't get too lost:

* [+] [Create](https://modrinth.com/mod/create)
* [+] [Farmer's Delight](https://modrinth.com/mod/farmers-delight)
* [+] [Just Enough Items](https://modrinth.com/mod/jei)
