# Changelog

## 0.3.0 - An age of exploration
This update focuses on the world players inhabit, trying to spice it up (while
still remaining true to the essence of Make²). The mods selected were picked
specifically because they make use of vanilla blocks, and don't add too much
beyond what is already expected in Minecraft. For now, this is a good balance.

In addition, they both play well with Create and it's reliance on normally
ignored stone variants, such as Andesite and Diorite and the use of Kelp as a
key ingredient in the production of belts.

The kinds of world generation considered fitting in with the "essence" of the
pack are likely to evolve over time, but for now this is a good start.

## 0.2.1 - I'm still on a GTX 1080
This patch includes a new collection of mods in here all to improve performance.
Which works out well because Minecraft (particularly modded) is in desperate
need of all the performance it can get.

the modlist will be incuded within the changelog.


## 0.2.0 - What is this?
This update adds Jade (and a small compatability addon to make it play well
with other mods, such as Create), so that players don't need to pull up the
debug menu to figure out what block is in front of them.

* [+] Jade
* [+] Jade Addons

As an aside, from here on out, new mods will be prefixed with a [+], and any
removals (hopefully not a large number), will be prefixed with [-].


## 0.1.0 - "Initial Commit"
This is Make² - a retooling of an in-dev modpack named "Make" that was running
on a later version of Minecraft. The goal of the modpack is to retain a very
vanilla feel, while still giving players the options of specializing down
specific ways-of-play.

This version adds the mods that inspired the pack the most, and one addition to
ensure players don't get too lost:

* Create
* Farmer's Delight
* Just Enough Items
