## 0.1.0 - "Initial Commit"
This is MakeÂ² - a retooling of an in-dev modpack named "Make" that was running
on a later version of Minecraft. The goal of the modpack is to retain a very
vanilla feel, while still giving players the options of specializing down
specific ways-of-play.

This version adds the mods that inspired the pack the most, and one addition to
ensure players don't get too lost:

* Create
* Farmer's Delight
* Just Enough Items
