#  Make²
A Create focused Minecraft modpack, with a healthy dose of farming.


## Installing
In order to play Make², you need to have a client capable of installing and
running [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/) packs. For this, we have used:

* [Prisim Launcher](https://prismlauncher.org/)
* [MultiMC](https://multimc.org/)
* [Modrinth Launcher](https://modrinth.com/app)

Once you have that, go grab the [latest release](https://github.com/jordanocokoljic/mc-make2/releases/latest)
and download the `.mrpack` file from the 'Assets' section of the release note,
drop that file into your launcher, and it should handle the rest!


## Feedback
If you're running into issues, have suggestions, or think something is not
quite right let us know via the [Issues](https://github.com/jordanocokoljic/mc-make2/issues)
tab.

We try our best to keep everything stable, so if it stops being that - let us
know!


## Contributing
This pack is managed via an excellent tool called [`packwiz`](https://packwiz.infra.link/).
If you want to build on this pack, install `packwiz`, clone the repository, and add as
many mods as your heart desires (and your CPU can handle).
